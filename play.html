        <h4>ACT I.

            SCENE I.--ARMANDE, HENRIETTE.
        </h4>
        <p class = "Direction">SCENE I.--ARMANDE, HENRIETTE.</p>
        <h6 class="Name">ARM</h6>
        <p class="Speech">O heavens! Can such ties have charms for you?</p>
        <p class = "Direction">SCENE I.--ARMANDE, HENRIETTE.</p>
        <h6 class="Name">HEN</h6>
        <p class="Speech">And what at my age can I do better than take a husband who loves
            me, and whom I love, and through such a tender union secure the
            delights of an innocent life? If there be conformity of tastes, do you
            see no attraction in such a bond?</p>
        <p class = "Direction">SCENE I.--ARMANDE, HENRIETTE.</p>
            <h6 class="Name">ARM</h6>
            <p class="Speech">Ah! heavens! What a grovelling disposition! What a poor part you
            act in the world, to confine yourself to family affairs, and to think
            of no more soul-stirring pleasures than those offered by an idol of a
            husband and by brats of children! Leave these base pleasures to the
            low and vulgar. Raise your thoughts to more exalted objects; endeavour
            to cultivate a taste for nobler pursuits; and treating sense and
            matter with contempt, give yourself, as we do, wholly to the
            cultivation of your mind. You have for an example our mother, who is
            everywhere honoured with the name of learned. Try, as we do, to prove
            yourself her daughter; aspire to the enlightened intellectuality which
            is found in our family, and acquire a taste for the rapturous
            pleasures which the love of study brings to the heart and mind.
            Instead of being in bondage to the will of a man, marry yourself,
            sister, to philosophy, for it alone raises you above the rest of
            mankind, gives sovereign empire to reason, and submits to its laws the
            animal part, with those grovelling desires which lower us to the level
            of the brute. These are the gentle flames, the sweet ties, which
            should fill every moment of life. And the cares to which I see so many
            women given up, appear to me pitiable frivolities.</p><br>
        <p class = "Direction">SCENE I.--ARMANDE, HENRIETTE.</p>
            <h6 class="Name">HEN</h6>
            <p class="Speech">Heaven, whose will is supreme, forms us at our birth to fill
            different spheres; and it is not every mind which is composed of
            materials fit to make a philosopher. If your mind is created to soar
            to those heights which are attained by the speculations of learned
            men, mine is fitted, sister, to take a meaner flight and to centre its
            weakness on the petty cares of the world. Let us not interfere with
            the just decrees of Heaven; but let each of us follow our different
            instincts. You, borne on the wings of a great and noble genius, will
            inhabit the lofty regions of philosophy; I, remaining here below, will
            taste the terrestrial charms of matrimony. Thus, in our several paths,
            we shall still imitate our mother: you, in her mind and its noble
            longings; I, in her grosser senses and coarser pleasures; you, in the
            productions of genius and light, and I, sister, in productions more
            material.</p><br>
        <p class = "Direction">SCENE I.--ARMANDE, HENRIETTE.</p>
            <h6 class="Name">ARM</h6>
            <p class="Speech">When we wish to take a person for a model, it is the nobler side
            we should imitate; and it is not taking our mother for a model,
            sister, to cough and spit like her.</p>
        <p class = "Direction">SCENE I.--ARMANDE, HENRIETTE.</p>
            <h6 class="Name">HEN</h6>
            <p class="Speech">But you would not have been what you boast yourself to be if our
            mother had had only her nobler qualities; and well it is for you that
            her lofty genius did not always devote itself to philosophy. Pray,
            leave me to those littlenesses to which you owe life, and do not, by
            wishing me to imitate you, deny some little savant entrance into the
            world.</p>
        <p class = "Direction">SCENE I.--ARMANDE, HENRIETTE.</p>
            <h6 class="Name">ARM</h6>
            <p class="Speech">I see that you cannot be cured of the foolish infatuation of
            taking a husband to yourself. But, pray, let us know whom you intend
            to marry; I suppose that you do not aim at Clitandre?
