        <h6 class = "Name">ARM.</h6> <p class = "speech">The empire which reason holds over the senses does not call upon
us to renounce the pleasure of adulation; and we may refuse for a
husband a man of merit whom we would willingly see swell the number of
our admirers.</p>

        <h6 class = "Name">HEN.</h6> <p class = "speech"> I have not prevented him from continuing his worship, but have
only received the homage of his passion when you had rejected it.</p>
        
       <h6 class = "Name">ARM.</h6> <p class = "speech"> But do you find entire safety, tell me, in the vows of a rejected
lover? Do you think his passion for you so great that all love for me
can be dead in his heart?</p>
        
        <h6 class = "Name">HEN.</h6> <p class = "speech">He tells me so, sister, and I trust him.</p>
        
       <h6 class = "Name">ARM.</h6>  <p class = "speech">Do not, sister, be so ready to trust him; and be sure that, when
he says he gives me up and loves you, he really does not mean it, but
deceives himself.</p>
